I tried putting it in the part of the checklist item that is always visible but there there was a concern with responsiveness and the full Level: AAA was taking too much space.\n@ericwbailey you mentioned in the issue that some checklist items might represent multiple success criterions. At least from what I saw each checklist item has only one WCAG link and each of those links only had one WCAG level asociated. That being said, I know for a fact that for example there are different contrast requirements for different levels but those don't seems to be covered in the checklist, just mention the one for level AA that is the minimum. Any thoughts on this? do you think that it's ok as I put it?\nThere was one checklist item that linked to a WCAG technique instead of a ""Understanding WCAG"" rule and didn't have a level asociated to for that one I put Level: doesn't apply. I thought about putting nothing at all but then it would have looked like it was missing.\nPreview\nEdited 9 months ago by Roshan Jossy\n👍\n0\n👎\n0\nAdd reaction\nPipeline #1816 failed for 7b5c8cbf on github/fork/aguscha333/feat/add-wcag-levels 9 months ago\nApprove\nApproval is optional\nMerge blocked: merge conflicts must be resolved.\nResolve locally\nResolve conflicts\n\nMerge details\n\nThe source branch is 290 commits behind the target branch\n6 commits and 1 merge commit will be added to main.\nSource branch will not be deleted.\n\nCloses issue #1209\n\nActivity\nSort or filter\nAdministrator added 3 deleted labels 2 years ago\nAdministrator\n@root\n· 2 years ago\nContributor\n\nCreated by: boring-cyborg[bot]\n\nThank you for opening this Pull Request!

Fixed :)\n\n Show thread\nAdministrator @root started a thread on an outdated change in commit f0c57cc5 2 years ago\nLast updated by EJ Mason 2 years ago\nAdministrator\n@root\n· 2 years ago\nContributor\n\nCreated by: scottaohara\n\nWhile I realize this content predates the work being done here (which all the work in this PR seems pretty great from what I've reviewed) I was reviewing the actual checklist content as well. There are some SCs that need to be updated as they are not accurately referenced, and I figured it would be better to just lump that all into this PR, rather than create any merge conflicts or what not.\n\nSo, here's the issues that jumped out at me when reviewing:\n\nMake sure that button, a, and label element content is unique and descriptive.\n\nthis is likely more a 2.4.4 issue for links (possibly 2.4.9 depending on context) and a 2.4.6 issue for labels... possibly buttons. It's a bit dicey putting these all together, but the point being that 1.3.1 doesn't really apply here. I'm not sure exactly what you want to do here, but I suggest at the very least removing the SC if you can't cite multiple SCs.\n\nUse landmark elements to indicate important content regions.\n\nThis would be a 1.3.1 issue. 4.1.2 is more about interactive content\n\nAvoid using the autofocus attribute.\n\nGenerally agree with this, but arguable if this would be a 2.4.3 issue. Sometimes using autofocus is exactly what you should do. Might be worth at least stating this is something to watch out for, rather than how this presently reads (to me) that it's an autofail.\n\nRemove title attribute tooltips.\n\nThis is arguably more of a 2.1.1 keyboard issue as - if the content is actually important - would generally be inaccessible to keyboard only users. since title is generally exposed to AT, 4.1.2 doesn't really hold true here.\n\nCheck to see that keyboard focus order matches the visual layout.\n\n1.3.2 may not apply here as content doesn't necessarily need to match visual focus order. 2.4.3 may be more appropriate to cite.\n\nheadings\n\nAll checklist items in the headings section incorrectly cite 2.4.6. 2.4.6 is about the quality of heading text, but has nothing to do with whether the text is properly exposed as a heading. These would all be 1.3.1/best practice issues.\n\nUse the th element for table headers (with appropriate scope attributes).\n\nUnsure why this is cited as a 4.1.1 issue. Seems it should be a 1.3.1\n\nUse the caption element to provide a title for the table.\n\nAgain, not a 2.4.6 unless there is a <caption> already implemented which has crummy text.\n\nAll inputs in a form are associated with a corresponding label element.\n\nNot a 3.2.2 issue. Typo for 3.3.2?\n\nAssociate input error messaging with the input it corresponds to.\n\nShould be 1.3.1 and/or 4.1.2.\n\nEnsure that media controls use appropriate markup.\n\nProbably should be 4.1.2 since that's about interactive controls\n\nConfirm that transcripts are available.\n\nTechnically yes, audio content is 1.1.1. But alternatives to audio content would generally be cited under 1.2.3\n\nCheck your content in specialized browsing modes.\n\nWould generally point to this as a strongly recommended best practice, not a wcag failure, particularly not this one.\n\nRemove horizontal scrolling.\n\nwould qualify some content - e.g., tables, maps, large graphs - are totally fine to have bi-directional scrolling. dont' want to make people think they have to negate table semantics and then potentially wind up with other wcag failures (e.g., 1.3.2) when content no longer makes sense in the reading order.\n\nEJ Mason\n@mxmason\n· 2 years ago\nContributor\n\nThanks for these notes, @scottaohara!\n\n@aguscha333, I'd be happy to implement the content changes Scott has pointed out, if you'd like. I think these changes could either go into this PR, or into a separate one dedicated to the rewrite.\n\nAgustina Chaer\n@aguscha333\n· 2 years ago\nAuthor\n\n@mxmason thanks for offering. If you don't mind I'd like to try to implement the changes myself to keep contributing to the repo. Those changes do touch more technical subjects about WCAG itself so what I will need is help with a thorrow review since I only recently started learning about accessibility so I could have some conceptual errors in the changes. I do think that it's better to do it in a separate PR since the new changes have nothing to do with the initial purpose of this PR. I can create a branch off of this one to get minimal conflicts.\n\nEJ Mason\n@mxmason\n· 2 years ago\nContributor\n\n@aguscha333 sounds good to me! feel free to tag me directly if you need anything!\n\nAdministrator\n@root\n· 2 years ago\nContributor\n\nCreated by: SaptakS\n\nSounds like a good plan to me too. I guess we are tracking it in #1277 now (thanks @mxmason for creating the issue!). In that case, according to me, this PR is ready to be merged. cc @scottaohara @ericwbailey\n\nByte Blaze\n@byteblaze\n· 2 years ago\nMaintainer\n\nI'd like to hold off on merging until #1277 is addressed. I don't feel comfortable merging if there are misrepresented SCs.\n\nAgustina Chaer\n@aguscha333\n· 2 years ago\nAuthor\n\n@ericwbailey @mxmason Tried implementing #1277 but going through the suggestions there are a lot that are more open ended and would require some more decision making from someone with more knowledge on the topic. I'm glad to keep contributing in the future but I think I need to sit this one out since I am still a newbie with a11y.\n\nAdministrator\n@root\n· 2 years ago\nContributor\n\nCreated by: scottaohara\n\nif you think more work needs to go into correctly citing the WCAG SCs, then I would suggest you simply comment out the SCs for the checklist items where there is not a simple swap out of the errant SC for the correct one.\n\nThen additional thought can go into the items that need more nuance, without continuing to cite inaccurate SCs while that work is being done.\n\nAgustina Chaer\n@aguscha333\n· 2 years ago\nAuthor\n\n@scottaohara @ericwbailey sorry it took me soo long to get back to this.\n\nUnfortunately comments are not allowed in JSON files so I had to remove them instead.\n\nI took the removal approach to most of the items mentioned by @scottaohara since most of the comments looked like were meant to open up discussions rather than this should be exactly like this or that.\n\nIf anyone wants to jump in and do something different for the ones I removed, totally cool with that.\n\nAdministrator restored source branch github/fork/aguscha333/feat/add-wcag-levels 9 months ago\nRoshan Jossy changed the description 9 months ago\nRoshan Jossy assigned to @ericwbailey and unassigned @aguscha333 9 months ago\nByte Blaze\n@byteblaze\n· just now\nMaintainer\n\nThank you\n\nWrite\nPreview\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSupports Markdown.
