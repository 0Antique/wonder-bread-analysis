Based on the screenshots provided, here is a step-by-step process (SOP) for how to approve positive reviews to display in the user’s store:

1. Click on the “MARKETING” button in the dark gray column on the left hand side of the page.
2. Click on “Pending Reviews” in the pop up menu, located under the heading “User Content”.
3. Scroll down to view all reviews in the review table.
