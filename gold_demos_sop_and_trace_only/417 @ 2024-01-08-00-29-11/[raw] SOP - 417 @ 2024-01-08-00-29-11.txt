To Go to the merge request on 404 link I have to review, find if the author of the merge request responded at the end, and reply "Thank you" if he did. Otherwise remind him with a simple @ yourself, do this:
1. Search in the top bar for "404 link".
2. click on the suggested result: "update or remove 404 links".
3. Scroll down until the last comment under "Activity".
4. Note that the author, @Roshanjossey, did not respond. 
5. Click on the "Write" input text.
6. Type the response "@Roshanjossey" in the "Write" input text. I wrote "@davepgreene Reminder!". 
7. Click on the blue "Comment" button.
