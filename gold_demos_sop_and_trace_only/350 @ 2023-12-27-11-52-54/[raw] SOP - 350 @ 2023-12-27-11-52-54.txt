To show me the usernames of people who have access to my repo "prism-theme", do the following.
1. In the purple "Search Gitlab" box on the very top left of the page, type in "prism-theme".
2. Select the option under "Projects" that shows up in the dropdown.
3. On the left sidebar, click on the first button "Project information".
4. On the screen, you'll see the usernames of the people in gray, starting with the "@" symbol.
