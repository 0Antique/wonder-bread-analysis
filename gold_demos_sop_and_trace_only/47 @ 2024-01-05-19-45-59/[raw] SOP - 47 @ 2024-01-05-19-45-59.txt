Based on the screenshots provided, here is a step-by-step process (SOP) for how to find how many fulfilled orders the user has over the past months, and the total amount of money they spent, given that today is 6/12/2023:

1. Click on the blue text "My Account" at the top of the page.
2. Click on the "My Orders" tab in the light gray column on the leftmost side of the page.
3. Scroll down to the next page button for the order table, located directly below the order table and to the right of the page numbers.
4. Click the next page button. This displays the portion of the user's order table containing information on orders within the desired date range, between 5/12/2023 (1 month before today) and 6/12/2023 (today), the status of those orders, located in the "Status" column of each order's row, and the order totals, located in the "Order Total" column of each order's row.
