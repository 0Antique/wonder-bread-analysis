Based on the screenshots provided, here is a step-by-step process (SOP) for how to tell the user the count of comments that have received more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the DIY forum:

1. Click on the “Forums” tab near the top left of the page.
2. Click on the sort criteria “Alphabetical”, located directly below the “Forums” tab.
3. Click on the red text “DIY” under the big, bolded letter “D” in the forums list. Scroll down to view the rest of the “D” category if necessary.
4. Click on the sorting criteria box with the text “Hot” inside it.
5. Click “New” in the pop-up menu.
6. Click on the username for the most recent post. The most recent post is the first row in the rows of results. The username is in bolded text underneath the post title.
7. Click the “Comments” tab, located below the red bar running along the top of the page.
8. Scroll through all the comments and count the number of comments which have more downvotes than upvotes, if any. Each row displayed is a separate comment. The number displayed to the left of the text of each comment is the net number of votes that the comment has received. If this number is negative, then the comment has more downvotes than upvotes, and should be counted.
