3. Click into the search box, located above the products table.
4. Type in “Chloe tank”.
5. Press enter.
6. Since there were no products found, we will modify our search query.
7. Delete “ jacket”.
8. Press enter.
9. Click on the product name of the relevant product. The product name is located in the “Name” column of the given row.
10. Scroll down to the “Product Reviews” section.
11. Click on the “Product Reviews” section to expand its contents.
12. Scroll down to view all reviews.
13. The reviews that express dissatisfaction can be found in this reviews table. Expressions of dissatisfaction can be found in the meaning of text in the “Title” and “Review” columns of a given row.
14. Since a review of interest by a user with a nickname doesn’t include their full name, we will try to find this user’s full name.
15. Click on the blue text “Edit”, located in the rightmost column of the row containing the review of interest.
16. The user’s full name is not displayed. Hence, we will simply record their nickname, located in the box directly to the right of the bolded text “Nickname”.
