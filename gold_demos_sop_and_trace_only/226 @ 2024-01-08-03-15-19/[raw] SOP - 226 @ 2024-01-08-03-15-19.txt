Based on the screenshots provided, here is a step-by-step process (SOP) for how to find the price range for products from Amazon basic:

1. Click on the blue text “Advanced Search”, directly below the search bar, located at the top, right hand side of the page.
2. Click into the “Product Name” text field, the box directly below “Search Settings”.
3. Type “Amazon basic” into the “Product Name” text field.
4. Press enter. This finds products with the phrase “Amazon basic” in their product name.
5. Click the “Sort By” criteria, located on the right hand side of the page.
6. Click “Price” in the pop up menu. This sorts search results from lowest to highest price.
7. Scroll down to the first row of product search results.
8. The price of the first product in the first row of search results is the price of the cheapest product sold by Amazon Basics.
9. Click the gray upward arrow directly to the right of the “Sort By” criteria. This sorts search results from highest to lowest price.
10. Scroll down to the first row of product search results.
11. The price of the second product in the first row of search results is the price of the most expensive product sold by Amazon Basics. The first product, although it includes an Amazon Basic product, is primarily a speaker sold by Polk Audio, and hence not overall a product by Amazon Basics.
12. The range in price between the cheapest and most expensive products sold by Amazon Basics is the price range for products by Amazon Basic.
