1. Click the blue "Advanced Search" text in the top right underneath the search bar.
2. Click in the search box located on the right of "Product Name".
3. Type in the keyword "card holder".
4. Click in the search box located on the right of "Description".
5. Type in the keyword "switch".
6. Press the "Enter/Return" key to make the search.
7. Click on the dropdown box located next to "Sort By", which has "Product name" written on it.
8. Click on the "Price" option from the dropdown list. This sorts products by price.
9. Since the grey arrow on the right of the dropdown down next to "Sort By" is pointing upwards, the products are sorted from the least expensive to most expensive. If the arrow was pointing downwards, then you would have to click on it once to change the sorting order.
10. Since the first product has "10" written in its description, it doesn't satisfy the minimum storage capacity criteria.
11. Click on the second item to check if it has the required storage capacity.
12. Scroll down to check this product's capacity.
13. Since the capacity listed is more than 15, and we had sorted the products in increasing order of price, we have found the least expensive switch card holder with a minimum storage capacity of 15 cards.
