1. Click on the "My Account" link at the top of the page. It can be found in the upper navigation bar. If it is not immediately in view, scroll to the top of the page to find it.
2. Click on the "My Orders" tab. This tab is situated in the light gray column on the left-hand side of the page.
3. Scroll through the order list and start identifying orders from the year 2022. To navigate through your orders, use the pagination controls located directly below the order table at the bottom of the page. These controls include page numbers and next page arrows. If the first page does not contain orders from 2022 or if you need to view more orders, click on the ">" (next page) button situated to the right of the page numbers. This action will take you to the subsequent page of your order history.
4. Once you find an order placed in 2022, identify it by the date listed in the "Date Placed" column. Then, click on the blue "View Order" link located in the "Action" column of the respective order row. This link will allow you to view detailed information about that specific order.
5. Within the order details page, scroll down to review all items included in the order. You are looking for an item that is described as a picture frame. The description and items are under the "Items Ordered" section of the page.
6. If the order contains a picture frame, note the size of the picture frame. The size is typically mentioned in the format (e.g., "8x10 inches").
7. In case the order does not contain a picture frame, or after noting the size of the picture frame, navigate back to the "My Orders" section by clicking on the "My Orders" tab again, located in the light gray column on the left-hand side of the page. Repeat steps until all orders have been checked. After reviewing all 2022 orders, if no picture frame items were found, your task is complete. If one or more picture frames were found, ensure you have noted down the size of each frame as required.
