To see how much refund I should expect from my order canlled in 2022/03? I only kept the AC-DC Adapter and the shop told me that I cannot get the shipping fee back yourself, follow these steps:

1. In the top navigation bar, click the button that says "My Account"

2. On the left side, there is a menu with an option "My Orders". Click the "My Orders" button.

3. The center of the page has a list of orders and their corresponding date and status. Underneath, there are buttons to navigate to different pages of the list (like 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). Navigate to the part of the list containing the relevant time frame, in this case "2022/03".

4. There are two orders within the time frame that have the status of cancelled. We need to look at both orders to calculate the total.

5. To see the total refund amount for the first order, click its "View Order" button. 

6. You will be brought to an order summary page. Near the bottom, there will be text saying "Subtotal" with a dollar amount next to it, in this case $186.59. Note that we want the Subtotal, not Grand Total, because we want the price without shipping fee. 

7. To go back to the list of all orders, on the left side of the screen, there is a menu with an option "My Orders". Click the "My Orders" button.

8. Use the numbered buttons under the list to navigate where you left off.
 
9. For the second cancelled order, to see the total refund amount, click its "View Order" button. 

10. You will be brought to an order summary page. Near the bottom, there will be text saying "Grand Total" with a dollar amount next to it, in this case $95.18. 

11. However, note that we are keeping the AC-DC Adapter, so we must remove the price from the total. In the Order Summary page we are on, there is a list of items and corresponding Subtotal in the item's row -- we can see the adapter is $17.28, so the order subtotal (not including the adapter) is $95.18 - $17.28 = $77.90.

11. To find the total refund amount for all the cancelled orders, add together the Subotals for each order. The total is thus $186.59 + $77.90 = $264.49
