Based on the screenshots provided, here is a step-by-step process (SOP) for how to find all reviews that the user’s store received so far that mention the term “not useful”:

1. Click on the “MARKETING” button in the dark gray column on the left hand side of the page.
2. Click on “All Reviews” in the pop up menu, located under the heading “User Content”.
3. Click into the text box located under the column with the heading “Review”.
4. Type in “not useful”.
5. Press enter.
6. The number of records found, which we can see directly above the “Created” column heading, tells us the number of reviews that mention the term “not useful”.
