How much refund I should expect from my order canlled in 2022/03? I only kept the AC-DC Adapter and the shop told me that I cannot get the shipping fee back?
1. Click on the blue "My Account" button on the top right of the page.
2. On the left gray sidebar menu, click on "My Orders".
3. Click on the blue "View Order" button for the row with an order date "3/2/22"
4. Scroll down until you see "Grand Total".
5. If you cannot get the shipping fee refunded, you should expect to get the number to the right of "Subtotal" minus the bolded number to the right of the AC-DC adapter as a refund.
