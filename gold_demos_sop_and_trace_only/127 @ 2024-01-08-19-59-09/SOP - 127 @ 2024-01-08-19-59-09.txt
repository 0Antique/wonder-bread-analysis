What brands appear most frequently among the top search terms?
1. Click on the "Reports" button on the far left-hand sidebar of the website's homepage. This button has an icon resembling a chart or graph. It can be found positioned above the "Stores" button and below the "Content" button.
2. Click on "Search Terms" in the "Marketing" subsection of the popout sidebar.
3. Click on the "Hits" column heading to sort the search terms by their hit count. If the list does not immediately sort in descending order (showing the highest numbers first), click the "Hits" column heading again. Sorting by hits allows us to identify the most popular search terms first. Examine the sorted table for brand names that appear among the top search terms. Given that the table is now sorted by hit count, the most frequently appearing brands should be among the first few entries. You might need to scroll through the first page of results or navigate through multiple pages of the table if the website paginates search term results. Identifying brand names within the list of search terms, may require some judgment to distinguish between generic terms and specific brand names.
