In order to see how much did I spend on shopping at One Stop Market on November 2022? They gave me a 20% discount on the total amount for orders exceeding $200 in cash yourself, follow these steps:

1. In the top navigation bar, click the button that says "My Account"

2. On the left side, there is a menu with an option "My Orders". Click the "My Orders" button.

3. The center of the page has a list of orders (each order is a new row) and their corresponding date and price (this information is in the columns). Underneath, there are buttons to navigate to different pages of the list (like 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). Navigate to the part of the list containing the relevant time frame, in this case "November 2022".

4. There are three orders which have a Date column value in this range. For each of these rows, add the value in the "Order Total" column for the final answer -- unless the value exceeds $200, then only add 80% of the order total. Here we add the three orders: $218.17*.8 + $133.07 + $51.94 = $359.546
