To Make the LICENSE of gimmiethat.space and dotfiles to MIT license yourself:

1. Click into the search bar at the top left of the page, with a purple background.
2. Type in the name of the first repo that the user wants to update (gimmiethat.space).
3. Press enter.
4. Click on the most relevant search result, i.e. the desired repo which we can edit. We can edit a repo if we are, for example, its owner or a developer, which we can know based on the “Owner” or “Developer” tag appearing to the right of the repo’s title.
5. If the project already has the MIT license, we don’t need to change anything. If not, follow steps 10-15 to update the license (and come back here when you are done).
6. Now we do the second repo. Click into the search bar at the top left of the page, with a purple background.
7. Type in the name of the next repo that the user wants to update (dotfiles).
8. Press enter.
9. Click on the most relevant search result, i.e. the desired repo which we can edit. We can edit a repo if we are, for example, its owner or a developer, which we can know based on the “Owner” or “Developer” tag appearing to the right of the repo’s title.
10. Click on the “Add LICENSE” button, located above the table of repo contents.
