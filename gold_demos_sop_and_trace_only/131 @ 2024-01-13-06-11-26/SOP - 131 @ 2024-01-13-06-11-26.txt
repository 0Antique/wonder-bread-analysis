3. Click on the "From" text field in the Orders Report filtering settings.  This field is for entering the start date from which you want to begin counting orders. Before typing in the date, ensure the field is empty by clicking inside it and pressing the "Delete" key if any pre-existing date is displayed.
4. Enter the Start Date for our search, in this case type in "1/1/23" as the start date in the "From" text field. This action sets the beginning of the date range for the orders you wish to analyze.
5. Click the "To" field directly below the "From" text field This field is designated for entering the end date of your order count period. Ensure this field is also empty before proceeding by clicking inside it and clearing any pre-existing date.

7. Click the "Show Report" button in the top right of the page. If the button is not immediately visible, scroll up to bring it into view.
8. Scroll through the generated report. This table displays various details about the orders placed within your specified date range. If the entire table is not visible, continue to scroll down to ensure all columns and rows can be seen. In the report table, locate the column labeled "Sales Items," which is typically the third column from the left. Starting from the bottom of this column, count the numbers listed in the rows for the 7 most recent orders (these will be the rows closest to the bottom of the table, excluding the very last row if it serves as a summary or total row). Add these numbers together to obtain the total number of items sold in the most recent 7 orders.
