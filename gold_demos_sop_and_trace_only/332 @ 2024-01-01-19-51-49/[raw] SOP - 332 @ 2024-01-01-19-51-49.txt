In order to see how much I spend each month from Jan to the end of March 2023 on shopping at One Stop Market yourself, follow these steps:

1. In the top navigation bar, click the button that says "My Account"

2. On the left side, there is a menu with an option "My Orders". Click the "My Orders" button.

3. The center of the page has a list of orders (each order is a new row) and their corresponding date and price (this information is in the columns). Underneath, there are buttons to navigate to different pages of the list (like 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). Navigate to the part of the list containing the relevant time frame, in this case "Jan to March 2023".

4. There are many orders which have a Date value in the specified range. Only consider the orders which have the order status "Complete"

5. For each of these orders, add the value in the "Order Total" column to find the final answer, which is Jan: $572.8, Feb: $762.18, Mar: $83.31
