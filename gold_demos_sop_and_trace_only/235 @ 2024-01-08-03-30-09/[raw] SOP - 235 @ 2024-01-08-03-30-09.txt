Based on the screenshots provided, here is a step-by-step process (SOP) for how to find the order number of the user’s most recent order:

1. Click on the blue text "My Account" at the top of the page.
2. Click on the "My Orders" tab in the light gray column on the leftmost side of the page.
3. The first row of the order table contains information on the user’s most recent order. The “Order #” column of that row describes the order number of the most recent order.
