What is the date when I made my first purchase on this site?
1. Click on the "My Account" option located in the top navigation bar of the website. If it is not visible at first, scroll to the very top of the page.
2. Click on the "My Orders" tab in the left sidebar in the "My Account" dashboard. This tab is specifically dedicated to viewing past and current orders, thus being our next step towards identifying the first purchase date.
3. Click on the highest-numbered page link within the pagination controls to navigate to the first purchase page. This action may require scrolling past the initial visible set of page numbers to the right, using the ">" (next) button if your order history spans many pages. If the pagination controls display numbers without a direct link to the last page, repeatedly click on the ">" button until you reach the last available page number, which contains your oldest orders. This step ensures you're viewing the earliest segment of your purchase history. Within the earliest page, locate the final row in the order list. This row represents the earliest purchase made on the account. The order list is typically organized with the most recent purchase at the top of the first page and the oldest at the bottom of the last page. The "Date" column within this row will display the date of your first purchase.
