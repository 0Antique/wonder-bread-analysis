Display the list of issues in the umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel repository that have labels related to BUG
1. Click on the "Explore" tab located in the top navigation bar, directly to the right of the "Starred" tab. This will direct you to a page where you can search and filter through available repositories.
2. Click in the "Filter by name" search box, which you can find in the upper-right corner of the "Explore" page. This box is labeled with a placeholder text "Filter by name," suggesting that you can type here to search for specific projects or repositories by their names.
3. Type the repository name into the search box, in this case its "AndroidSlidingUpPanel". Ensure that the box is clear of any previous text before you start typing. This step is crucial as it narrows down the search results to include only those repositories that match or closely match the text "AndroidSlidingUpPanel".
4. From the list of search results that appear below the search box, locate the repository from the correct user, in this case it is "Umano: News Read To You / AndroidSlidingUpPanel". If you do not immediately see this repository, you may need to scroll down through the search results.
5. Click on the "Issues" tab located on the left side of the repository's page. This tab is part of a horizontal menu that includes other options like "Merge Requests" "CI/CD" and "Deployments". The "Issues" tab will take you to a page listing all the issues associated with the Umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel repository.
6. Click in the "Search" bar at the top of the issues page. This search bar is specifically for filtering and finding issues within the repository. It is typically labeled with placeholder text such as "is:issue is:open" or "Search all issues".
7. Click the "Label" options from the dropdown menu that appears upon clicking the search bar. This action specifies that your upcoming search term should be considered a label attached to issues. In this case we are interested in the BUG label.
8. Click the equals sign "=" that appears next to the "Label" option you just selected. This action sets the search filter to match exactly with the label name you are about to enter, ensuring that only issues with labels that exactly match your search term are displayed.
9. Type "BUG" after the equals sign in the search bar. This action is directing the search to filter for issues that are specifically labeled with "BUG", which typically indicates issues related to bugs within the project.
10. From the autocomplete suggestions that appear as you type, click on the label that is named "BUG". This action ensures that you are selecting the correct label for filtering the issues.
11. Press the "Enter/Return" key on your keyboard to submit your search query. This action will filter the list of issues to display only those that have been labeled with "BUG". The resulting list of issues that are displayed on the page now specifically includes those in the Umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel repository that have been tagged with the "BUG" label. If the full list of issues is not immediately visible due to the length of the page, scroll to view all the listed issues.
