Get the order number of my most recent order 
1. Click on the "My Account" button. This button is found at the top right-hand corner of the homepage. If you cannot see it immediately, scroll to the very top of the homepage to bring it into view.
2. Click on "My Orders" in the sidebar menu on the left side of the screen. This option is usually positioned towards the top of the list. The sidebar is a light grey to make it identifiable from the rest of the page.
3. Scroll to identify the most recent order. To identify the order number of your most recent order, look at the first row of the table under the "Order #" column. We can expect the orders to be in chronological order, with the most recent order displayed first. This means the most recent order should be the first order in the list.
