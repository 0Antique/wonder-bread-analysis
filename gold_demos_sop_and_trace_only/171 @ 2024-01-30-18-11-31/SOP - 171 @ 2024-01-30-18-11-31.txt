Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got less than 5 stars?
1. Click on the box to the right of the "Filter by name" box and under the blue "New project" button.
2. In the dropdown, select "Most stars" under the "Sort by" section.
3. Scroll down on the page until you see a star icon followed by a number less than 5. The star icon is a column (vertically aligned with the "Filter by name" box).
4. That repo and all repositories under it have less than 5 stars.
