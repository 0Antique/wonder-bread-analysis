Today is 6/12/2023. Tell me how many fulfilled orders I have over the past month, and the total amount of money I spent.
1. Click on 'My Account' in the top bar.
2. Click on 'My Orders' in the left grey box.
3. Since no orders in this page are within the past month, click on the '>' button to go to previous orders.
4. This page has orders in the past month. Since none of them have the completed/fulfilled status, the total fulfilled orders are 0 and the amount spent is 0.
5. Since orders in this page go more than a month before today's date, we have covered all orders for the past month.
6. Report the number of fulfilled orders and the amount spent.
