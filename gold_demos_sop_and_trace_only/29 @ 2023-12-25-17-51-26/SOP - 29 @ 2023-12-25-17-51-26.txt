Tell me the count of comments that have received more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the DIY forum.

1. Click on the tab labeled "Forums", which is the 2nd tab in the top red menubar. The tab should be at the right of the "Postmill" tab and at the left of the "Wiki" tab.
2. Click on the third gray tab at the top labeled "Alphabetical". This gray tab is located below the top red bar, at the right of the gray "Tags" bar.
3. Locate the section "D" at the bottom left of the screen and click on the red "DIY" link at the bottom left corner. This link should be below the red "deeplearning" link and above the red "Documentaries" link.
4. Click on the sort dropdown menu which has a symbol of two arrows: one facing up and one facing down. The dropdown menu says "Hot".
5. From the dropdown menu which showed up, click on the "New" option. This should be the second option and it should be below the "Hot" option and above the "Active" option.
6. Click on the black bold text corresponding to the username which corresponds to the first submission you see on the screen. The username is in bold, black text and follows the words "Submitted by". the text should be above a red text which says "No comments".
7. Click on the third gray tab at the top labeled "Comments". This tab should be at the right of the gray "Submissions" tab and under the top red bar.
8. Scroll down until you reach the bottom of the page. While scrolling, count the number of times you see a negative number. This number should be located below an upwards facing arrows and above a downwards facing arrow. The number should be at the left of each comment which is enclosed in a gray bordered box.
9. Output the count you made. That is the number comments that received more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the DIY forum.
