Based on the screenshots provided, here is a step-by-step process (SOP) for how to tell the user about the organizations involved in any posts among the top 10 posts in "books" forum talking about supporting local bookstores:

1. Click on the “Forums” tab near the top left of the page.
2. Click on the sort criteria “Alphabetical”, located directly below the “Forums” tab.
3. Click on the red text “books” under the big, bolded letter “B” in the forums list. Scroll down to view the rest of the “B” category if necessary.
4. Click on the sorting criteria box with the text “Hot” inside it.
5. Click “Top” in the pop-up menu.
6. Click the time criteria box with the text “Past 24 hours” inside it.
7. Click “All time” in the pop-up menu.
8. Scroll through the first 10 posts, i.e. the first 10 rows.
9. Return the organizations involved in supporting local bookstores, if any, based on the top 10 posts. Each post is in a separate row. The large text to the right and above the post rating number is the post title, which contains information on the subject of the post, and potentially any organizations involved.
