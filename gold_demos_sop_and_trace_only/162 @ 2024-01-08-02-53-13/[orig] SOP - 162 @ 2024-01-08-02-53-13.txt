I have a lot of Nintendo Switch game cards now, help me find the best storage option to fit all 40 cards
1. Click into the search bar, located at the top, right hand side of the page.
2. Type “Nintendo Switch game card storage” into the search bar.
3. Press enter. This finds products related to storage options for Nintendo Switch game cards.
4. Scroll down to the first row of product search results.
5. Click on the first product search result, “Game Card Holder Storage Case…”, since the third product search result has too little storage capacity (24 cards) and the second product search result likely has much more storage capacity than ideal (160 cards).
6. Scroll down to the “Product Description” section of the page.
7. This product is likely one of the best storage options for the user’s 40 game cards, since it is around the same price as other game card storage options and has an appropriate storage capacity (up to 40 game cards).
