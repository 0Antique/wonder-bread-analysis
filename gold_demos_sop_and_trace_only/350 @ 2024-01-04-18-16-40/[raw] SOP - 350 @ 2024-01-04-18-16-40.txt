In order to see who else have access to my repo prism-theme, show me their usernames yourself:

1. In the top right corner, there is a search box that says "Filter by name". Click on this textbox to type.

2. Type in the name of the repo, "prism-theme" until the one relevant repo shows up on the screen. You might not need to type the full name for it to appear. 

3. Click on the name of the repo.

4. On the lefthand side, click on the menu option that says "Project information"

5. Underneath the "Project information" button on the lefthandside menu, click the button that appeared that says "Members". Click this button. 

6. You will see a list of all the members who are a part of the repo, with their usernames following an @. In this case we see @byteblaze (which says "It's you") and @abisubramanya27. In this case, it's just abisubramanya27.
