set the homepage URL on my GitLab profile to a11yproject.contributor.me
1. In the top right corner, click your profile picture which is a circle that occupies the rightmost position in the header.
2. In the dropdown menu that appears, click "Edit profile"
3. Under the "Main settings" subheader, scroll to the "Website url" field which has a textbox under it.
4. Delete any text that is in the textbox. It would stat with https:// (note that any valid url must start with this to be accepted)
5. Type in your desired url. Make sure to add https:// at the front, so it reads "https://a11yproject.contributor.me", or it won't be accepted.
6. Press "enter" when you are done so it updates the URL. It should show a popup that says "Profile was successfully updated"
